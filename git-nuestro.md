*Git* our Father who art in repositories,

Hallowed be thy *commits*.

Thy *log* come,

On the local as it is in the *remote*.

Give us this day our daily *pull*,

And forgive us our *conflicts*,

As we forgive those of other geeks.

Lead us not into *detached HEAD*,

And deliver us from *SVN*.

`git commit --amend`
